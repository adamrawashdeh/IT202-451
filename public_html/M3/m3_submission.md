    2. **Important**: The function that drives one of the challenges is `updateCurrentPage(str)` which takes 1 parameter, a string of the word to display as the current page. This function is not included in the code of the page, along with a few other things, are linked via an external js file. Make sure you do not delete this line.  
5. Create a branch called M3-Challenge-HW if you haven't yet
6. Add this template to that branch (git add/git commit)
7. Make a pull request for this branch once you push it
8. You may manually deploy the HW branch to dev to get the evidence for the below prompts
9. Create a new file **m3_submission.md** file in the hw branch and fill it with the output generated from this page (be careful not to paste more than once)
10. Add, commit, and push the submission file
11. Close the pull request by merging it to dev (double-check all looks good on dev)
12. Manually create a new pull request from dev to prod (i.e., base: prod <- compare: dev)
13. Complete the merge to deploy to production
14. Submit the direct link of the m3_submission.md from the prod branch to Canvas for this submission

<table><tr><td> <em>Deliverable 2: </em> Explain Solutions (Grader use this section to determine completion of each challenge) </td></tr><tr><td><em>Status: </em> <img width="100" height="20" src="http://via.placeholder.com/400x120/009955/fff?text=Complete"></td></tr>
<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Briefly explain how you made the navigation horizontal</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>For horizontal navigation I&nbsp; put &quot;display:inline&quot; which puts the elements inside nav in<br>the same line.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how you remove the navigation list item markers</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>For removing navigation list item markers I pull &quot;list-style:none&quot; which removes it as<br>a list.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain how you gave the navigation a background</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>For giving navigation a background I just put &quot;background-color: lightseagreen&quot; and that turned<br>my navigation background to that color.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Briefly explain how you made the links (or their surrounding area) change color on mouseover/hover</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>For links change color I used the :hover selector and inside of it<br>I put &quot;color:red&quot;. This meant that when I was hovering over a specific<br>link it would change to the color I chose which was red.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Briefly explain how you changed the challenge list bullet points to checkmarks (✓)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>For checkmarks I put &quot;h3 + ul li:before&quot; this would apply change for<br>all things after the h3 tags. Then inside I put &quot;content:<span style="letter-spacing: 0.09996px;">✓&quot;.<br>This part all together&nbsp;would put a checkmark before all elements&nbsp;that happen after the<br>h3 tag.</span><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 6: </em> Briefly explain how you made the first character of the h1 tags and anchor tags uppercased</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I directly chose h1 tags, and anchor tags and put &quot;h1::first-letter, a::first-letter&quot; and<br>inside put &quot;text-trasform:uppercase&quot; This chose the first letter for each of theses tags<br>and capitalized it.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 7: </em> Briefly explain/describe your custom styling of your choice</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>For my style of choice I decided to do 3 things: center the<br>nav, higher the font, and put spacing between the words. I did this<br>by using &quot;word-spacing&quot; (spaces between the words), &quot;text-align: center&quot; (centered the words), and<br>font-size (changes the size of the font).<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 8: </em> Briefly explain how the styling for the challenge list doesn't impact the navigation list</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>To make sure no styling would impact the other I would go to<br>the direct name of each of the parts I would want to style.<br>For example, when I wanted to do font size I would put &quot;nav<br>li&quot; which will only apply to things inside the navigation bar.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 9: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the h1 tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I made an array with all of the links (login, register, profile, logout).<br>After I would call each one individually and when either one of the<br>4 were clicked it would pass it into updateCurrentPage() and make the h1<br>tag that name.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 10: </em> Briefly explain how you updated the content of the title tag with the link text</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I made an array with all of the links (login, register, profile, logout).<br>After I would call each one individually and when either one of the<br>4 were clicked it would pass it into updateCurrentPage() and make the title<br>tag that name.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Comment briefly talking about what you learned and/or any difficulties you encountered and how you resolved them (or attempted to)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>It was a bit difficult to change the h-1 tags and the title<br>tags. However, I solved it by going to the tutoring hours and asking<br>for help. I was guided step-by-step and understood the solution.<br></p><br></td></tr>
